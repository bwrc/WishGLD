# WishGLD
Wisconsin-ish Global-Local Dissociation protocol

Repo contains the implementation of the WishGLD protocol, described here http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2016.00238

Main code includes:
 * WCST_final.py - the implementation of the protocol for PsychoPy 1.81.0
 * generateSetJSON.py - create configuration JSON files that define blocks of matching rules and repetition counts
 * halftone_localshapes_gen.py - generate a full set of stimulus cards built from local shapes
 * halftone_localletters_param.py - generate a limited set of stimulus cards built from local letters (at v1.81.0 PsychoPy could not create as many font objects as needed for full card set)
 * locallettergen.bat - Windows batch file calls the local letter generator to create the full set of stimulus cards
 
Repo also contains:
 * experiment configs - 32 json files under \configs which contain 8 Latin square permutations of the existing set files
 * set definition files - as generated by generateSetJSON.py, in \configs\sets - N.B. these have an ordering issue as reported in Frontiers
 * experiment instructions in Finnish
